# Palindrome Checker in Python 🐍

This simple Python code allows you to check if a word is a **palindrome** – a word that reads the same forwards and backwards. 🔄

## How it works:
- The program compares the original word with its reverse.
- If they match, it’s a palindrome! 🎉
- You can easily modify the code to test other words.

## How to use:
1. Add your own words to test in the code.
2. Run the script and see if your word is a palindrome! 📝

> **Example**:  
> Input: `racecar`  
> Output: `True`
